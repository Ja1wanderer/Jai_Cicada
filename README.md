# About me
## My MBTI
### Given this excellent tool, I am a solid N (instinctive) and F (feelings) person. My I/E and P/J depend on what language I use when I am performing certain tasks. 
### If I am working in English, I am more of an extrovert (E) with a higher sense of order (J) and am better at organising stuff and plans. 
### On the other hand, if I am in Chinese mode, I am a more introverted person, just like the poets from Ancient China (LiBai, Dufu, SuShi, etc.). I am more flexible with changes and more romantic.
## General Identity
### I am recently figuring out who am I without all these shells, but since we are in human society, these shells help one another to understand who is one another, so these are my shells:
#### A Malaysian Chinese
#### A freshgrad in Agriculture and Environmental Science
#### A Martial Artist that is looking for a proper boxing gym
#### A newbie coder that likes to read
